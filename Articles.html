        <div>Will Congress and BRS Implement 42% Reservations in Local Body Elections 2025?
As the 2025 local body elections in Telangana approach, political attention is increasingly focused on one key issue: the implementation of 42% reservations for Backward Classes (BCs) in local governance. Both the Congress Party, currently in power in Telangana, and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), the principal opposition, are under growing pressure to act on what has become both a legal and social demand.

üèõ Background of the Reservation Demand
Local body elections ‚Äî including those for Mandal Parishads, Zilla Parishads, and Municipal Corporations ‚Äî play a critical role in shaping grassroots governance. Over the years, various communities have called for increased representation, especially Backward Classes, who make up a significant portion of the population but remain underrepresented in elected bodies.

The demand for 42% reservations for BCs is based on socio-economic surveys and political consensus that BCs deserve proportional representation in these institutions. The figure comes from earlier estimates suggesting that BCs constitute around 50% of the state's population.

‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Policy Landscape
The issue of reservations in local bodies is complex. The Supreme Court of India, in several judgments, has mandated that any increase in reservation must be backed by data and cannot exceed the 50% cap unless justified. However, in the case of local body elections, the court has shown some flexibility ‚Äî provided the government conducts a BC socio-economic survey and satisfies the triple test criteria:

Identification of backwardness

Inadequate representation

Administrative efficiency impact study

üè¢ Congress Government‚Äôs Position
Since coming to power in 2023, the Telangana Congress has emphasized social justice as one of its pillars. The party has publicly committed to empowering BCs, and Chief Minister Revanth Reddy has stated multiple times that his government would not shy away from constitutional or judicial obligations.

However, while statements have been made, there is still no official notification or completed survey that would satisfy the Supreme Court's triple test ‚Äî a legal requirement to implement the 42% quota.

üß≠ What About the BRS?
The BRS Party, which ruled Telangana for nearly a decade, is also being questioned. During its tenure, the party promised increased reservations for BCs but never fully implemented them in local body polls. Critics argue that despite having both political power and time, BRS failed to act decisively on this front.

Now in the opposition, BRS leaders claim they were ‚Äúon the verge‚Äù of implementing 42% reservations before losing power. Whether that is accurate or political posturing remains unclear.

üìä Public Sentiment and Political Pressure
Among BC communities, especially in rural Telangana, the issue has gained momentum. Several community organizations and civil rights groups have conducted protests, demanding immediate action from the state government.

The 2025 elections are expected to test both parties on this issue. For Congress, it's a chance to prove its commitment to backward communities. For BRS, it‚Äôs an opportunity to point fingers and regain lost political ground.

üîç What's Next?
If the Congress government wants to move forward with implementing the 42% quota:

It must complete the BC census or survey.

Satisfy the legal framework set by the Supreme Court.

Amend the state law, if necessary, to support these changes.

Failure to do so could turn this into a major election issue ‚Äî and potentially cost votes in rural Telangana, where BCs are a powerful electoral bloc.

üìù Conclusion
The question is not just "Will Congress and BRS implement 42% reservations?" ‚Äî but "Who will act first, and how quickly?" The 2025 local body elections are more than just a battle for panchayats and wards; they‚Äôre a referendum on social justice and political accountability.

As political parties gear up, the electorate is watching ‚Äî and so is the law.
